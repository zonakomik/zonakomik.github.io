I entered the gate with full of joy. I took a seat in the first line of the show. The instructor of the dolphin was calling some volunteer to come forward. I raised my hand and got called by him. He told the dolphin to kiss me on my cheek. The dolphin did as he told. I was kissed by the cute dolphin.
I was so happy the dolphin kissed me on the cheek. I went home with singing together with my family.
